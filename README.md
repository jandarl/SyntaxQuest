This is the repository of my personal website https://syntax-quest.vercel.app/

My target for this website is to share my projects and my journey on creating those projects. This is where I also share my work experience and hobbies in hope that people
may get to know me better. This will always be a work in progress as I hope that I could regularly update this when I have completed or started a small or big project that I could share.
Currently, I am trying to learn new things and is figuring out what project would I like to do next to showcase my progress.

The front end is created using React and React Bootstrap, this currently has no back end and is instead using JSON as the data storage for the information. I would like to migrate it in the future
on a hosting space where I could connect it to a database server to make it better and safer as I will be able to separate my front end from the data and introducing a back end.
