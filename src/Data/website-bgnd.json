	"description":"The website background is a PNG file hooked using CSS. Since we would like for it to always cover the whole website, we will add it to the \"html\" selector using the \"background\" property, we used the \"url\" function to attach the PNG file. In the example below, the PNG file is located at the Public folder of the project.\n\nWe then set the \"background-size\" property to cover so that it would always cover the entire webpage ( caution: if the PNG file is not big enough, it will be stretched ). The \"background-repeat\" property is set to \"no-repeat\" to prevent the image from repeating if the webpage is bigger than the image, we let the cover stretched itself to accommodate for the extra space. \n\nWe set the \"background-attachment\" property to fixed to make sure that the image does not scroll as the page is scrolled. This is largely for preferences as for me a moving image in the background is a bit tiring to the eye. \n\nLastly, the \"min-height\" property will ensure that the \"html\" selector will not shrink lower than the size provided. This is entirely, developer preference.",
