	"description":"Often I would use rounded-edged containers for the website, from the headers to the body where the color of the upper side gradually transitions into another color on the bottom together with the of opacity.\n\nThe gradient part is achieved by first declaring the original color of the background through the \"background-color\" property using the \"rgba\" function, we are able to set the color (rgb) and then the alpha (a). For the opacity, the setting is 0.0 for fully transparent and 1.0 for fully opaque.\n\nTo create the gradient effect we will use the \"background-image\" property with the \"linear-gradient\" function. This function will take in the direction of the gradient and then the we can use the \"rgba\" function to set the color and opacity of the two transitioning colors.\n\nIn the example, since we set the direction to 180deg, that means we are essentially flipping the colors vertically. The first color will be at the bottom and second color will be at the top.\n\nFor the final touches, we use \"backdrop-filter\" property with the \"blur\" function to make a bit of a blur effect for the background. We also use \"border-radius\" property  to round the edges of the container.",
