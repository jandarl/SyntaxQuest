I have decided to post all the updates I make in this page to communicate atleast a bit to the guest how the website is coming along. As you may have observed, the website updates in the past few weeks has been slow and small. I have been working on some projects that is not yet ready to be published but hopefully soon, I could start posting it here. I am also starting to work my way in learning Database (PostgreSQL) which I hopefully could also post some of my progress here when I have grasped it enough. Thank you for visiting and hopefully some of the things I have posted previously helped you in any way.",
